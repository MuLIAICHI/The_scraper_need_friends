## Purpose 🎯

The primary purpose of this repository is to create a fun and educational environment for beginners interested in web scraping and data processing using Python. Join us on this adventure, where scraping websites and making friends go hand in hand! 🌐🤝

## Folder Structure 📂

Our folders are like secret hideouts, each containing a Python script and the corresponding file format in which the data will be saved. They're disguised with clever names, revealing the magical powers of data storage! For example, you'll find a folder named "JSON version" where our Python script works its magic to save data into a JSON file! 🧙‍♂️📜

We welcome all aspiring web scrapers and Python enthusiasts to join our quirky crew! Here are some ways you can contribute:

1. **Write the Pandas File** 🐼: Channel your inner panda and create a Python script that leverages the power of Pandas for data processing. Find the perfect folder name to showcase your file format prowess (e.g., "Pandas version"). Let's make our data processing game strong! 💪🐼

2. **Transform the Script into Functions** 🔄: Want to sprinkle some modularity and reusability into our magical code? Transform the existing Python script into functions. This way, our scraper becomes a versatile spellbook that others can use to scrape different websites or customize for their own adventures! 🧙‍♂️🔮
